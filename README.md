jquery.captionate.js
====================

I wanted to create image captions for my blog using HTML5, so I was excited to find out that HTML5 provides the new `<figure>` and `<figcaption>` elements. The HTML5 spec says that's exactly what these elements are intended for. 

I wanted clients to be able to easily upload an image into their page using a content management system, then mark the image as "having a caption" using a CSS class. I realized I needed to write a JQuery script which would grab the "marked" image and automatically generate the code for `<figure>` and `<figcaption>` around the original image. 

I originally wrote the script to use the image's ALT attribute to supply the caption text. However, as adrienne noted the ALT tag should not be used for image captions. See the [W3C Spec](http://www.w3.org/html/wg/drafts/html/master/embedded-content-0.html#alt). So I modified the script to use TITLE instead.

See example.html for an example of how to use the script. And, see [my blog article](http://www.highintegritydesign.com/blog/articles/image-captions-in-html5-using-figcaption-and-jquery) for a complete tutorial on how the script works.
